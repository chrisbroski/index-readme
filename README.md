Index README
============

*Index README* is a stand alone HTML page that automatically imports a GitHub repository's README.md and displays it as web page. Just put a copy of the *index.html* page in the root directory of your GitHub repository, and when you deploy to [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), your README.md file will shown as the default web page.

*Index README* uses [Showdown.js](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) for markdown conversion (most recent version from 2015-01-03) [Simple.css](https://github.com/chrisbroski/simple-css) for basic page layout and a little extra CSS based on [Github style markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/) so styles are similar to how your GitHub README file is displayed from your repository.
